            <h3>The Return of Bam Margera</h3>
            <p class="font_weight">MARCH 13, 2017 / IAN MICHNA & ALEX RASPA / INTERVIEWS</p>
            <p>Whether you liked it or not, Bam Margera blew skateboarding up in the early 00s. Because of shows like Jackass and Viva La Bam, every kid in America wanted to get a heartagram tattoo on their dick and have an Element board in their hand. Skating hit the mainstream and if you could actually do tricks, you became the coolest kid at the school overnight (and maybe even got some makeouts a few times because of it).
Of course, Bam’s skateboarding understandably slowed down with all the TV obligations and fame. It was clear that Bam was always wild, but it wasn’t clear that he had an actual problem. It wasn’t until the promos for Family Therapy came out, until most people realized that their childhood icon was actually struggling.
Bam didn’t look like he was in any condition to skate. However, that’s when the Instagram posts started popping up and the rumors surfaced that yes, Bam was back on a skateboard. After several phone calls and some luck, we tracked him down deep in Spain to see what’s really going on.
Congrats Bam on the continued recovery and thank you for picking up a skateboard once again.</p>
            <p>So Bam, you’re skating again?</p>
            <p>Yeah! I was just skating Roberto Aleman’s mini ramp at his dad’s house. He’s got a bullfighting ring and a mini ramp with a big Consolidated logo in the middle of it, with all these old pictures of Tom Cruise, the fucking band Europe and Rob Lowe. It’s weird. [laughs]
Years ago you said you stopped skating because your feet were messed up. What happened?
Yeah, well, it was like bone spurs in my feet, I had like six of them. The reason why I took so long to get them fixed was because it didn’t hurt to walk or run, it just hurt to land tricks skating. So it was never really a rush to go get them fixed.
Then four or five years went by where I didn’t skate, and if I did skate it was simply cruising around FDR or at the park at my house, but nothing serious. Then winter came and I was in Estonia editing a movie about this guy Andy Mccoy. He plays in a band Hanoi Rocks with Iggy Pop. It was like October and it was already snowing and dark by 3:00pm. I was like, I’m gonna kill myself if I don’t get to Barcelona and skate. So I flew to Barcelona, bought my first skateboard in 20 years and met up with Winkle [filmer]. From there, we’ve kind of been taking a road trip all over Spain for about 2 months.</p>
            <p>What board did you buy? When you walked in the store were people like…  “holy shit it’s Bam!”</p>
            <p>It was like a surf/snow/skate shop, so it wasn’t like a core skateboard shop. I don’t think they recognized me there. I bought a Madars Apse Element board. I was thinking like, I’m buying an Element board… the company would send me 20 of them for free every month [laughs] but there I was buying one. It was just easier to do that than waiting 10 days for a Element box to hopefully show up at an address that I didn’t know yet. I didn’t know where I was going.
</p>
            <p>Do you still have ties with Element or did that end a while ago?</p>
            <p>No, not anymore. I get it though, MTV was first priority and so was Jackass. You know, my 5 hours of skating a day disappeared. When you’re filming TV stuff all day and there’s 40 people there getting paid to film you, my skating turned into 2 hours a day, then 1 hour a day, then for a while it was no hours a day.
Now that I’ve been out here skating, Element got in touch with me and said, “If you want to release another model or an old limited edition type thing, or just go on Element tours, you’re more than welcome. We want you back on board.” So, that sounds good to me, but I’m 37 though [laughs] so it pretty much hurts to do anything down more than 4 stairs. That’s why I like transition, it hurts less.
Spain is the perfect place for that. It’s like banks everywhere and by the time the session is done the kids recognize who I am, so I don’t get bothered until after I’m done skating. When I was home, it was really ridiculous. I would pull up to the skatepark and it was like the fuckin’ Hollywood red carpet. Everybody would have their cameras out, and I’m not gonna let anyone film me suck for 30 minutes, so I just wouldn’t skate.</p>
