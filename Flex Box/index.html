      Getting hurt skateboarding is as inevitable as shitting your pants after eating Indian food, we know what we are getting into when we play with fire. It does not matter if you are pro, or just a dad trying your kids board after a few cold ones, slamming happens to the best of us.
A lot of injuries go untreated and end up getting worse as they heal improperly, which can cause major problems down the road. Neglected injuries are usually due to either lack of funds to cover a hospital bill, or just simple ignorance. To help, we put together a short gallery of the most common injuries in skating </p>
